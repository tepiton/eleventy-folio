This starter is designed for long-form literary work published in chapters.

The core workflow:

1. Edit `_data/book.js` with your project metadata.
2. Add chapter files in `content/chapters/` with `order`, `chapterNumber`, and `title`.
3. Edit the homepage and chapter listing copy to match your project.
